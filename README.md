# Project Todos

A todo list built in Redux with reducers. Able to add, check off and delete tasks as well as keep count of them.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next? I had some issue with getting my background to toggle when clicking the slider I created. I solved it with same solution I had for last project + an if else statement. Did not plamn anything really. Felt that this week was pretty straight forward, yet not easy!
